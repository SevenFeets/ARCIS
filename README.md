## About ARCIS

ARCIS (Advanced Real-time Camera Identification System) is a system designed to [brief description of what the system does - e.g., "detect and track objects in real-time video feeds using computer vision and machine learning techniques"].

## Repository Structure

This repository contains only documentation and design artifacts. The implementation code is maintained in a separate repository.
