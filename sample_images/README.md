# Sample Detection Images

This folder contains example images with bounding box visualizations from the ARCIS weapon detection model.

The images show the model's detection capabilities for different types of weapons including:
- Knives
- Pistols/Handguns

Each image includes:
- Bounding boxes around detected weapons
- Class labels for each detection
- Confidence scores for the detections
- Inference time

These samples demonstrate the model's performance in various scenarios and can be used for documentation or presentations.

## Model Information
- Model type: YOLOv8/YOLOv11
- Data trained on: Custom weapon detection dataset
- Classes: Knife, Pistol

For more information about the model and its training, refer to the main project README.
